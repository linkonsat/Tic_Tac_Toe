# Tic_Tac_Toe

a Tic_Tac_Toe game run on ruby through the terminal. If your interested in playing feel free to clone this repository and enter ruby Tic_Tac_Toe.rb to start playing! The highlights of this project was learning how to use objects but, also how to manipulate the objects using custom methods from both modules and classes. As well as the object creation processand mixing in modules to classes.
